# arduino

Learned basics of arduino environment from examples.

Wrote program to read from sensors and use shift registers to control 120V components (heater, fan, humidifier, etc) and a solenoid valve on garden hose. Receives and transmits over serial to a c++ program running on a raspberry pi. Required soldering diode onto valve power source so circuit doesn't fry due to back emf. Completely unsafe.
