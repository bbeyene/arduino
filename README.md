# arduino

Learned basics of arduino environment from examples.

Impemented code for reading from sensors and using shift registers to control 120V components and a solenoid valve fit onto garden hose.

Receives and transmits info over serial to raspberry pi c++ program written command line executable.

Required soldering diode onto valve power source so circuit doesn't fry due to back emf. Still completely unsafe. Good stopping point.
